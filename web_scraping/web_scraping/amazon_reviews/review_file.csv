Bhavsar","I don't know why these storage manufacturers use 1000 bytes as 1K.  Computers use 1024 bytes as 1K.  So, when they say 64GB its actually 59.6GB.  After connecting to my laptop I see 58.4GB which is normal as the FAT32 filesystem needs some space to store the metadata.,I did some experiments with data transfer.  I transferred about 40GB to and from this USB stick.,For large file sizes (>100MB to 2GB):  Write speed 10MB/s,  Read speed 25MB/s, write/read speed is constant,For small file sizes (1KB to 50MB): Avg write speed 6MB/s, Avg read speed 6MB/s, write/read speed varies between 2MB/s to 20MB/s,Good product. After so much hesitation I decided to buy USB 2.0 pen drive although it's speed is slow.  I was little bit nervous if I will got original  product or not. It's not like that. I got the genuine product . You will get approx 29.2 GB storage in 32 GB pen drive.  Delivery service was very fast . I got this product  within 3 days after I ordered.It's little bit tight in my USB slot.  It's also heated up after using few minutes. But it's normal. Nothing to worry about these problems .,Sandisk the best in storage devices I feel..,They offer a reasonable price for their product and also provides good lifetime of the pendrive.,I bought this product for my friend...I can blindly recommend this to any normal user... It's writing speed is fast so does reading speed...Transfer rate is decent...,This is me buying this product for the 3rd time...I grabbed it on a lighting deal...,Delivery is super fast, it did delivered me before 24 hrs...,#One incident to share:,My mum washed this pendrive not just once but twice...But to my amazement it really worked super fine . THUMPSUP to SANDISKüëç,I thank Amazon for super fast delivery...Nice work...,actually i am a physics teacher. i wellknown about the storage concept. Surely there will be some plus or minus will be there. but in my 32GB pendrive 29 GB only there. If we buy 16GB means 14.5 GB only theren now my question is why its happen. U can say 1000 reason. if surely some losses will come means instead of 32, u have to develop 35 GB, then some losses means we can get 32 GB, why you are not do like this.,Itss showing  117 GB not 128 i think  not original..,When a person purchases 128 GB pen drive then it surely means that he is going to store large files in it. But this pen drive has FAT32 system which allows to store files of size upto 4 GB. I had to convert its system to NTFS through third party software to store files having size larger than 4 GB. So I think the file system of atleast a 128 GB pen drive should already be NTFS.,Large size file doesn't transfer like over 10 gb size file otherwise its a good product.work properly.,I purchased it for Rs.395.,Pros-,1. Made of good quality material.,2. Fairly good read and write speed for USB 2.0.,3. Easy to install.,4. Convenient shape which makes its handling easy.,Cons-,1. Made up of plastic, not metal. So somewhat breakable.,2. Reading speed not very fast as it is not USB 3.0 compatible.,Final comment- Go for it if you want a cheap pen drive. If you want a high speed and durable pen drive then go for some other metal USB 3.0 or 3.1 pen drive.,This pendrive is totally fake, i ordered it on a lightning deal bcoz it stated 16gb, i did not know that after formatting it the memory will decrease so ridiculously , guys its actual size is just 299 MB  i don't know how when i started using it , it worked fine, i used to copy and transfer movie files well above 5gb but all of a sudden when i once formatted it, the memory lost, HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. I will never buy any stuff from lightning deal , they sell fake/defective products  on lightning deals,I purchased 64 gb pendrive on Saturday and recd on Sunday but it was not working properly so I requested to return or replace. However I got replaced pendrive on Tuesday but it is sorry to say that the pen drive is also not working properly like not attached with my smart TV. I twice formats but not working. I request to please refund my money. I am regular purchaser and prime member of Amazon.

This product was packed compactly as expected from Amazon.,Now we only have to talk about product -,Writing speed 4-5MBPS,Reading speed 15-18MBPS,It's writing speed(from PC to Pendrive) is only 4MBPS that's really bad as compare to SanDisk Cruzer Blade 8Gb it gives writing speed somewhere 9-10MBPS.,While Reading speed has almost no difference in 8GB and 16GB SanDisk Cruzer Blade Pendrive.,But if we compare price of 8gb and 16gb Pendrive there only 50-60 rupees difference. you get double of storage at just 50-60 rupees. 16GB Pendrive is better buy if we compare price and Value 4 money","Reviewed in India on 26 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 17 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 22 July 2018,Reviewed in India on 26 July 2018,Reviewed in India on 20 April 2018,Reviewed in India on 14 May 2021,Reviewed in India on 25 October 2016,Reviewed in India on 29 July 2021,Reviewed in India on 13 August 2017,Reviewed in India on 19 February 2018,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2018,Reviewed in India on 19 September 2017"
"Jayakara Kini,boriesh,Abhishek Gupta,Ananthan MPR,Yogesh Thakur,Puneet,Puneet,Rajib,Rajib,Arun Barua,Uzair Noman,RowV,Abdul Subhan,Anand Kumar","I bought this pen drive during the lightning deal ad got it for just 349/- that means I paid 10.90625/- per 1 GB  of data and if I calculate like this Jio charges a roughly amount of 17/- rupees per 1 GB of data and if I compare the value then I am saving approx 7 rupees per 1 GB of data.,I know you would consider this review silly but this pen drive isn't super fast but gets the work done.,The packing is improved better than it used to be plus the transfer rates between 7MBPS to 15MBPS.,The pen drive is compact and original that I can share with you all.,If you liked the review you can mark this review helpful and follow us for more reviews. As we post technology reviews,frequently.,I had ordered a Scandisk pen drive of 64gb.  I I received the pen driveproduct where it was mentioned 64 GB,However when I tried to use the product I realised the real capacity was only 32 GB & not 64 as requested . This is a serious quality control issue & raises questions about the electronic items which we purchase from Amazon.,Secondly Amazon is refusing to replace this item,Thirdly the customer care put my call on hold indefinitely & refuse to address my concerns,Is the poor customer over charged & not have a recourse,I have been a regular amazon customer but this raises concern about my dealings in future if this is how we are treated,Am writing this review after the usage of the device after 3 years, and still its working like hell. Faced no problems till now, the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives. If you are thinking of buying a good pen drive with great speed and performance, and for lifetime usage, this is the perfect product, just go for it.,Hi I have been using it for more, than 6 months and writing review now.,1. It had a consistent average write speed of 3.5MB per sec which is lesser than a sandisk class 4 memory card which goes to 8MB per second. It took me an hour to fill the complete space with Bollywood songs and cartoon movies for my nephew and nieces.,The read speed however goes ad high as 20 MB per second which is pretty good for copying.,I just filled 16 GBs with movies for once and play it on TV. Previously I used it on set top box for recording. You can use it for small data transfers measuring in 100- 200 MBs.,As per performance is considered i would suggest for USB 3.0 pen drives;which i have one  writes 8-9 MB per sec almost 4 times fast than USB 2.0.,Build quality it average and fragile; and tip usually breaks easily with little mishandling.,Thanks.,So, I bought the SanDisk Cruzer Blade 64 GB. I receive the product. Unbox it. Plug it in my computer. And this is what I see. 32GB total storage and out of that 31.9GB available. That means the drive has only half of the 64GB that I actually bought!  However, on the side of the product, it mentions clearly that it is a 64GB unit. How is this even possible?? Check the screenshots attached and the images. I threw away the packaging (yes I had a brain fail). Now, I can't even return this product.,REMEMBER : Its not 3.0 OR Class10,So if you can compromise on speed, its the best.,Quality and performance : 100% SATISFACTION,1. The very first day my mom put it in the washing machine along with my pant.,2. I lost it on the road near my house. A week after that my friend found it crushed by some vehicle, bathed in rain and mud.,Proudly Announcing STILL WORKING FINE,Allowed to copy data on the usb for first time. In second time, i was copying some setup file to move it across systems and the sandisk pen drive turned write-protected all of a sudden. Now i hv a 16 gb pen drive which cannot be formatted. I cant delete or add anymore data. Anything i try to do, it just keeps giving disk is write protected error. Dont buy Sandisk usb if u want to reuse it.,These pen drives are cheap and I think top selling brand due to its price and reliability,Pros:,‚ñ∫ Cheap ( Bought for ‚Çπ209 from cloudtail under lightning deal),‚ñ∫ Performance is good,‚ñ∫ Reliable memory (no problems like data corruption or failed usb drive till now after 3 years),‚ñ∫ Suitable for storing songs,‚ñ∫ Works with almost any hardware,‚ñ∫ Suitable for car player, mp3 players.,Cons:,‚ñ∫ The plastic body wears easily (usually USB tip breaks after using it for couple of years),But even after broken tip the pen drives are working fine.,SanDisk is the only brand I prefer when it comes to storage solutions, coz I have been using since 2003. This one too is a excellent product,,I got,4gb pendrive - 3 nos,8gb pendrive - 1 no,16gb - 1 no,32gb - 2 nos,All works well, storage in all those drives are quite good, but this one consumed too much, I got only 26.2gb, I don't know what's the problem here, my older one provides around 29gb. Don't have time for R&D else I would have spotted where the extra gb is missing. Anyways will chyonce with service center too when I get time, as of now using it for entertainment purpose, no issues working flawless.,This is probably the most bought pen drive in its segment. On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.) The second drawback is the color. As it is the same for everyone else, so losing it in office (college groups) is quite possible. The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.,It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability. The speed it gives is not lightning fast but it works for most Indian made laptops (or desktops). If you plan to use it with your car stereo system, I would suggest you go for a pen drive with a metal body (this won't work for long).","Reviewed in India on 26 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 17 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 27 January 2020,Reviewed in India on 27 September 2020,Reviewed in India on 11 October 2017,Reviewed in India on 7 January 2019,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2020,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2017,Reviewed in India on 15 February 2018,Reviewed in India on 6 August 2018,Reviewed in India on 23 December 2021,Reviewed in India on 11 October 2018"

SO I SUGGEST YOU TO BY ANOTHER PENDRIVE WHO LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE .BUT WORK FINE AS COMPARE TO THIS PRODUCT. IF YOU WANT TO SHARE OR KEEP SMALL FILES YOU CAN (BECAUSE THIS PENDRIVE CHEAPER THAN OTHER ONES),I m sorry to say that I had a really bad experience with this device. I used it for recording my laparoscopic surgeries. Initially it worked well for sometime then it started troubling. It would NOT record or delete the recorded stuff. So the new piece I would prefer to buy from the local market. Thanks,Bholla Singh Sidhu,I got the worst product,It was an artificial product large in size ,it's too  light in weight, can't insert it in laptop due to its different size comparison to original pen drive ., This is my first time I got problem in Amazon product. It would be  fine if this was exchanged, but the Amazon service neither refunded nor exchanged the product.,I feel guilty for buying this pen drive,  i have waited for 17days for exchanging delivery.,I bought two of these pen drives. Good quality product with decent data transfer speed. By default, it did not allow me to copy a 14GB file, even though there was enough free space. The error appeared on the screen was ""file is too large for destination file system."" This was because of the FAT32 limitation. I had to format the device as NTFS to proceed. As I have just started using these pen drives, I will not be able to comment on their durability.,This is my third SanDisk cruzer blade pen drive. These little pendrives are so handy and sturdy. I have been using these pendrives for years as being an IT guy. LOL I might have plugged these in and out a million times a year and still these hold up really well. Even though these are made out of plastic, these are quite rough and tough. Not once have I faced and issues with Data corruption or anything. These little things keep working and working. Absolute value for money!!,Came as expected. The outer packaging wasn't good but the inner product packaging was good.,The transfer speed is good. Read and write speed is nearly same as mentioned.,Feels lighter than old ones but still ok.,I got 29.8 Gib of space from 32 GB as the correct storage of 32 gb counts 29.8 gib in digital storage.,The product is manufactured in Ireland and imported from Malaysia.,It's actual price is ‚Çπ650 but i got it for only ‚Çπ349 without delivery charges.,With all these things, you get 5 years manufacturing warranty in case if it stops working due to manufacturing defects.,
                    The media could not be loaded.
                ,¬†The product came in sealed packing, and with all well copied handiwork to make it look original. The moment you take out the pendrive, a child can tell it's fake. Light , flimlsy built, as if one blow will break it. The real test is when you plug to pc. Instead of SanDisk Cruze , it says generic usb in the device name which confirms it is fake. Additionally, instead of 32 gb which original SanDisk remains, it is only 29 GB. Don't sell fake products idiots!,Edit: item replaced and yet another similar item sent. I guess I will have to make peace with this. Shouldn't have gone for the cheap price.,This is so worse. This says 128gb on the pen dirve and cover but comes with capacity of 64mb.,Don't know this fraud is done by SanDisk or Amazon. The return window also closed. So I am stuck with this useless product and wasted all my money.,If Amazon really cares about customers and keeps track of review then do check this issue out.,Making fool of innocent customers.,This is so cheap as buying from road.,First of all KUDOS!!! to amazon for such a quick delivery,I literally ordered it yesterday evening and wasn't expecting the delivery guy to be here by the next MORNING!!!!,As for the product,Its 58.7 GB (I guess its same with all manufactures regardless of the size of the disk),Has a speed or around 9.5 MB/ sec,Kind of slow maybe,Will give a detailed review after a while,& also it doesn't heat up in as quickly as do the 8gb & 16gb versions.,Really  disappointed  with the product.  With a great hope opened pen drive to start my important  work., I inserted  in to my laptop and waiting to transfer files in to that drive.  But after some its not showing anything,  then I Removed and shocked to observe that the pendrive does not have anything hardware inside to store the data.,I don't know how these people will send an item without  verifying.","Reviewed in India on 26 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 17 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 21 November 2017,Reviewed in India on 3 June 2019,Reviewed in India on 27 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 24 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 13 August 2020,Reviewed in India on 7 December 2020,Reviewed in India on 7 January 2022,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2021,Reviewed in India on 15 September 2021,Reviewed in India on 24 October 2019"
"Jayakara Kini,boriesh,amarrav,ANKIT VERMA,Arpita Ganguli,RAOOF UDDIN,Baby Kurrey,Amazon Customer,Prem Katarnavare,Prem Katarnavare,Karan Agarwal,Silver Dove,Hitesh kumawat","As per the product line it's a set of 2 but I have received only one pen drive which is so frustrating.,I received the Pendrive in 128GB Cover. But when I opened it and tried to insert it into my Computer! It didn't work. So I placed a request for Replacement. Today it was returned as it is. But now the Corrier Boy is saying that I returned a 32GB Pendrive! Look i returned it as it is as I received! How could I return you a 32GB Pendrive, when I never bought any 32GB Pendrive ever.,My primary preference for flash drives has always been SanDisk. In the early years before SanDisk came along, I had used some other lesser known brands - and had invariably ended up losing data (""Cannot be Detected"" type of errors). As a musician, I need to transfer heavy music project files between audio studios, mastering studios, etc. and for reasons of confidentiality and security, one can't use services like SendSpace and WeTransfer. I have always used SanDisk flash drives and I have faced no problems, no glitches. One doesn't need to carry an external hard drive and risk the other contents of the drive - much easier to use separate flash drives for separate projects.,Bottom Line: SanDisk is reliable, safe and trustworthy. That's all you need when you buy a flash drive.,Didn't have any problem while delivering the product. It is in good condition and working fine.But I disliked that there was a very long wait to get this item it was almost 11 days after placing my order.By the way, the product is small and very much comfortable and easy to use in our hectic daily life,I've ordered 2 pendrives... One is working good and another is not working... I haven't checked it just after buying it.. i checked it after 3-4 weeks later.. and i found 1 is working and another is not.. as returning date was end the product is wasted... And  total waste of money and seller is not seller... Lier ,fake and cheater.. don't buy anything from this seller.. how a person can trust again... Money is not a joke ok, you should know 1 rupee has also its importance..,First of all the whole 32Gb never showed, it was some 4 to 5 GB less at the very start. The next day the capacity reduced to half. I doubt whether these are original ones, returned it at the earliest.never going to buy sandisk again,Pretty nice and slim pendrive it's really Slim actually... It has a nice Matt finish with a little glossy textured frame in the middle. But it feels pretty fragile to me because it's very light weight super light! The speed :- As you know any new storage device will give faster speeds and this one jumped upto 376 MBps... While moving from internal to USB it went from 0.2-24 MBps with an average of 4-8 MBps it kept fluctuating so much that it's very hard to decide a number. While copying both ways around, it went with 85 MBps most of the time! While moving from USB to internal, it did 30-35 MBps with mostly staying at 30 MBps...!!!,I've used different brands of USB drives over the years and I found that SanDisk is the best from them all.  Several times I had my USB drive left in my pockets and it gets washed and it still works with all the data intact in it.  Now, I don't buy any other brands when it comes to USB drives.  I only have to buy SanDisk again if I accidentally lose them, otherwise they just go on and on and on.,Waste Product Sent in first receive . Received defective seems seal tampered product and not fresh one. It did not work. Then no option for refund . I opted for replacement. Replacement product started on first week of December it was lost again replacement sent reached nearest delivery station but remains undelivered Even after 3 weeks. It's a waste of time and energy. Don't buy sale items they are refurbrished,ell guys there are some good things I liked about the device and some things I don't liked about it. So let's start.Good things_ 1) Price: -the SanDisk cruzer blade is one of the cheapest usb flash drive now days. It's worth the price almost.2) Use: -the SanDisk cruzer blade is easy to use device. It's pretty small and you don't even need too much space to keep it.Now the bad things_ 1) Speed: -the data transferring speed is not good.t Other device in this price range is better than this.2) Build Quality: -the build quality of this device is not up my to the mark. It's made up of cheap kind of plastic and there are some creacky noise.3) Design: -it doesn't looks good. Looks so cheap and not cool.Well guys these are my experience with SanDisk cruzer blade flash usb drive. I'm using this device for 5-6 months and really I'm not satisfied.","Reviewed in India on 26 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 17 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 21 October 2018,Reviewed in India on 19 February 2021,Reviewed in India on 15 August 2021,Reviewed in India on 22 September 2017,Reviewed in India on 10 May 2019,Reviewed in India on 16 January 2021,Reviewed in India on 29 November 2021,Reviewed in India on 30 October 2019,Reviewed in India on 26 December 2021,Reviewed in India on 20 September 2019"

So, the speed is little slower than other modern day drives supporting USB 3. Price is good and I am using it for backup. Very light in weight and fits very well in USB of my laptop. Linux detected it without any problems. Working very well. If you are looking for a drive to ueas a travelling companion, then this is a great deal.,It seems to be a duplicate product. The shape, size, lebel of this product is not identical to the other one I received. Also it is not properly fitting to the USB port of computer and mobile adaptor. Moreover it is not responding to any system device.,Quality and reliability, for data storage, nothing to out smart SanDisk in affordable pricrange.,The only thing is that the cruzer blades are small and can get lost or replaced.

And prompt delivery.,32GB drive offers 28GB space. Same as any 2 TB drive nearly 1.81GB space. So just sharing this.,Looks nice, sturdy, useful, but drive mouth/ male doesn't have a cover. So need to keep it protected from dust. You will need to re-format is using a tutorial on Youtube if you wish to use it for music in your car.,At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy this pendrive, because of its price. Of course, there were other alternatives like HP, but I thought, anyway let's give this one a try. So, I ordered it and it arrived the next day. I bought this for my Xbox 360 E and my PS4 and it worked like a charm. Although it says 32gb, I only actually got 28gb. I would say this  pendrive along with its read/write speed is really worth it. And if you're worried about the fake pendrive, don't worry, this is the original pendrive which comes with 5 years warranty. If you're looking for a reliable pendrive at a really low price, I would highly recommend this one.,The stem of the drive is made up of thin plastic, but the  USB port which is inserted into is metal. Feel will get damaged over fewer uses as compared to a metal stem, which most other USB drives are made up of.  It is suggested to spend a little extra bucks & go for a more sturdy & better constructed ones.,Bought in 2015, till now working fine..pen drives dont fail mostly. So dont worry.. The plastic is drawback as the front inserting plastic broken but still we can insert..usually it will break as we plug and unplud frequently.. Apart from that it is the best budget pendrive... Buy it only if it is low priced . below 260rs. Dont buy if it is above 300 for 32gb pendrive. It has good speed and long lasting... Water proof.. Very much useful for boot usb. After formatting and changing from FAT to NTFS and back to FAT the speed was reduced ..iam not getting the initial high speed.. So dont format this pendrive frequently... Best budget 2.0 pendrive .,After using this pen drive for my backup purpose need found it's data transfer speed to be not as feasible as other devices in this range. If you want to transfer 1 GB of data it might take 10-15 min of time. The storage capacity is sufficient as compared to money. The weight of Pendrive is minimum and be carried in your wallet. The built quality of the pen drive is not adequate.,This is one pendrive I am purchasing it repeatedly from the beginning, when I started using pendrives. My usage is simple, for my car audio and as a storage device. Still now I have not faced any issues with this black and red pendrive.

When I insert it in my computer, notification shows that ""usb 2.0 is connected"" while other sandisk 64GB pendrive shows ""SanDisk Cruzer Blade is connected"". So.........,Again when I insert it to my phone using otg, notification shows that ""VendorCo is connected"" while it should show that ""SanDisk Cruzer Blade is connected"". And many times it is not supported by my phone and needed to format.,N.B.,1.  The volume label of this pendrive is nor 'SanDisk Cruzer Blade' not 'VendorCo' and not 'USB 2.0'. The volume label was my name.,2. I use windows 10 on my pc.,3. My phone has android 10.,Nice products,Has almost the same size as labelled on the pendrive,Can copy and share date with a much better speed,Easy to handle and doesn't get spoiled much faster,It is hard and durable,It would  definitely be helpful to you,It worth money,The data transferring speed was awesome,Also has a six month warranty for this product,Anyway I am satisfied with this product  and if this review was useful to you then please vote helpful below this review box,Amazon once again proved its quality,This USB drive can be bit of struggle when plugging it in to a laptop or TV ..same when plugging out..since it's plastic..that portion could break if not used carefully..,For people large hands,using can be quite frustrating considering the size of the drive.,Works with OTG cable for use with supported mobile phones..,Overall it's an okay drive..,I had brought this item its not worth it maybe its a duplicate,Its mentioned 128gb but recently when I wanted to download some more folders it was showing full,Actually i had downloaded earlier ony 43gb but remaining space has to be unfortunate its showing full,And cant return because its already time lapse,So beware before buying this product it‚Äôs misleading,Ordered a quantity of two,  but got only one.  Since this was an urgent purpose,  I had to go and buy again two from outside.  Now the customer center is telling that there is no refund policy and there is only replacement policy.  But the replacement was going to take many more days by which time the purpose for which the pendrives are purchased for would not be served.,In short,  robbed basically and lost money.,Pros :,The overall build quality ( including speed ) vs price when compared with other ones is impeccable.,Cons :,1. Provides a speed around 3-6 MBps which is a bit less when compared to top brands like Sony, HP etc,1.Since made entirely of plastic, regular rough use may result in damage,2. The pen-drive heats up a lot if used constantly for a long time,PS:- for further insights, benchmark and speed tests, comparisons, refer this link-,http://usb.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/1349/SanDisk-Cruzer-Blade,If you buy this usb drive outside they will cost you 200rs more.But value for money and it's sandisk as well.The only issue is its usb 2.0 not 3.0.I have a 3.0 drive in my opinion it's faster transforming files.But if you on a tight budget I would recommend this.,This 32 Gb pendrive its just amazing, small and easy to carry, the transfer rates are very good.,The secured vault software that comes with it is an incing on the cake. Its password protected and u can save all ur private files in the vault, so even if u lend ur pendrive to someone u dont have to bother of removing those private files and saving somewhere else :),I recommend this sandisk pen drive to all and amazon service is the best, giving tough competition to other big e-commerce sites, well done.Very good product handling .,A great little USB with fast speeds and high storage for a relatively low price.,My own complaint is that the USB is surprisingly tiny. I thought it would be a normal sized pen drive. But honestly it's more like a micro-usb. It's about an inch and a half. It might be the smallest USB I've ever owned. I'm always worried that I'm going to misplace it.,But other than nitpick, what you see is what you get. Not a thing wrong with this product.,This is my 4th sandisk cruiser & like earlier ones, it works very well. The transfer speeds are good especially once it's formatted to NTFS from FAT32.

Heated up a little more than usual during formatting once but now seems to work just fine...,Edit: Now that it has been 6 months, I thought maybe I should update my review. Sandisk still works well but the heating is becoming an issue. Data transfer for a couple of minutes and it starts to heat up. On the contrary, my friend's HP pen drive works very cool and you won't even feel it's temperature despite it have a metallic body. In conclusion, Sandisk is good but if you have already had one I would prefer to look for other options and experiment a little to find my perfect pen drive,Good product. I used it for a while now. Still working fine. But the body is really fragile. The sides of the usb broke in 6 months. So if you are looking for long term regular use i would not recommend this product. But for the price it is good.,Storage Capacity is good. While using on Laptop Lenovo G50-80 it fits very tightly.Though it may look fine ,over a period it may cause problem either to pendrive or to USB port on Laptop. Anyway it is a good value for money. There is no provision to hang it anywhere or to keep it with key bunch.,Sandisk Pendrive 64 GB had saved me a lot of money as instead of changing SD Card in my smartphone or upgrading to a large space capacity smartphone sounds costly but this pendrive save me a lot of money and helped me in saving my data from my smartphone via OTG,Excellent quality the product which I, received was Malaysia made.

I have used SanDisk cruiser blade pendrive 16GB before but this 32 GB variant did not last long. In fact, within a month it stopped working. I tried with desktop and laptops but the systems could not connect to it for access. A close friend inferred the software within has corrupted and is now useless.

The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too. Over all good,I got it for only 500/- . It's a steal deal for me . Great product for great value. Service was also good. Only a point to note that it's 2.0 i.e slower speed and can't transfer big files(greater than 5gb),You have to change the file system then you can transfer. Otherwise good,It super compatible with pc, very fast Tranfering spped upto 32mbs max, also give great support as playing through otg cable on a tablet gives  unstop support.

It is the perfect size for when you are need to lug and not wanting to hurt it and fits in your pocket for travel, only thing wish it had was a way to cover the end so that way not accidently hurt it when traveling and to keep the dust out. Overall great product and would buy it again.,It works, in the sense you can read and write data on/from it :-). It is slow, even for a 2.0 USB. It is also bit tight to plug in to the USB port of the laptop. Other than that no complains. Worth the price.,Super Product then product comes with 57GB and writing speed is very slow for movies it will take 10 minutes to move for songs and office work it fits perfectly,Good quality, the speed is higher than 2.0 pendrives, its speed is between 6mbps to 20 mbps.,I recommend it.,This is for 64gb, it is good, got 6 to 12 mbps.,This product is nice having good storage capacity, using since many years as there different versions of gb it has versatility in nature and i must say it has value for money product !!,You can take more money to increase the space but promising 64 gb and giving 56gb is very bad.

I count on it. It gives me less waiting time while copying or accessing data where I feel it is faster than others.,So, SanDisk Cruzer 16GB is fast in speed and moreover provides encryption for files which works on Mac and Windows both whether keeping pics, mp3, videos, data files or using for OS recovery as bootable the perfect pen drive it is in all needs...

This is as cheap as it gets while offering solid storage. But make no mistake, it's performance is strictly mediocre. Good only for copying small files here and there.

Thereafter it stopped working in the sense it has not been recognised by either computer, laptop, smart tv or smartphone.  As the due date has passed I could not return immediately. Hence this representation. Please resolve tis issue.,I want to purchase scandisk pendrive but by mistake in reading I purchase this SANDISK. It looks like scandisk make but no guarantee of data,Seller denied warranty on laptop received few days back inspite of 6 months seller warranty advertised on product page,I just got this product just a few hours ago and I must say its really small, yet rugged. It is so small that if you are not careful enough to slide a lanyard around it, you are likely to lose it. My primary purpose of buying the flash drive is to play music on my TV and the bundled encryption software was initially a hassle. There was an easy remedy - just place the files outside the encryption vault and you are good.,I decided to buy this on Amazon after I compared price of this product on Flipkart. It was around Rs 50 cheaper on Amazon. Having experienced Flipkart's speedy delivery service before, I wasn't sure if Amazon would be able to match it but I was willing to give it a try. And to my surprise, it reached me in two days(though it was estimated to arrive three days later). Thank you, Amazon. You saved me time and money:).,Product is as not as good as I expected.,It is totally faulty product. I can't connect with some phones. Phones are otg supported but it is not working.

I would recommend purchasing it. :),wow nice beautiful product. get it in a beautiful moment i.e. in super deal. But I think the price of this product (i.e. a 16 GB flash drive with USB 2.0 Ports) is costly now in online. Few month ago I buy same product form Snapdeal only in 315/-. But now I buy it in price 375/- also in Lighting Deal. How buffo. But not a bad............,If you don't care avout read and write speed its good for the price. Otherwise its super slow.,The Pen drive is 32 GB so it should be provide atleast 30 GB but they are given me 28 GB ,, which is really not acceptable. Please don't buy this product which is doing cheating with the customers. I don't understand  how Amazon like big brand has allow such product in there website,Your standard Sandisk falsh drive at USB 2.0 speeds. Trustworthy and durable. The lack of a cap is a boon and a bane. One less thing to loose but at the cost of leaving the USB plug unprotected, Time tested product. Go for it if you don't want any risk and are looking for a cheap yet reliable flash drive.,Often stops responding and gets corrupted and does not work until you format it again,I have probably formatted it for 2 to 5 times,But it gives an awesome read-write speed,one of the smallest yet cheapest pendrives out there, so if you are cash strapped then go for it.,generally, it works good.I've been using this for 10 months now,I bought it when the price was 289 and what more can you get in rs.289? The pendrive is working fine for the last 6 months and I've encountered absolutely no problems so far.,Pros:,Cheap,Reliable,Relatively Fast,Cons:,No ""cap"" like kingston,Products storage memory is not 32GB as showed on amazon's website (amazon.in).

Handle with care since it's small and built with plastic -there is a lot of chance that you might damage it.,A simple and straight forward device which ticks all boxes for storing files. San disk is very reliable, almost my previous 8 to 10 usb drives are san disk. Highly recommended.,They should have write its 2.0 in title , I bought it for 350/- which is too much for 2.0 pendrive. Rest writing speed is 12MB reading maybe up to 20MBS,Build quality is poor compared to other products at the same price range like HP.Metallic body is advised for long life.Storage capacity is 28.6 gb only,hi i buy this pendrive at 208 rupees it is class 4 product but look like 8 class product very fast file transfer so good quality of songs and videos so good if u want a good pemdrive below 250 go for it but 1 problem is there is no light but it is very good like other brands.I buy another pendrive at 159 rupees so good thanks amazon,It's fine but has to be careful while plugging in the USB socket cos its all plastic. (USB plug cover is not of metal) so it may break while using.,Am using It from Last 1Year ! Its Good To have Pen drive Of 32Gb in around ‚Çπ450-550 !,Its Writing speed is about 5 Mbps(Max)...,& Reading Speed is good !  As its 2.0 ! So ,we can't expect it behave like a 3.0 !,Overall Its Good !

I have a concern when it's going to break during every usage of this pen drive.,Never buy any sandisk product you will never get warranty.,This is pendrive is superb it's come with 5 year warranty and i have call to sandisk customer care service centre to authenticate this pendrive is orginall or not but this pendrive is got detcted by them this is a original pendrive so go for it this orginal sandisk pendrive just call sandisk customer care center pendrive they will assist you,i have open it today but it is not working, nothing is showing in laptop. my return time has over on 28oct21. i received it on 20oct21. return time is very less. i was thinking that return time would be 1 month.,Quality of the plastic is not good and atleast they should provide the cap to the pendrive. Should keep the product very carefully,Works well - got it at Rs 370/- which seems a good deal.,Good transfer speed on Windows  - about 20MB/s consistently while xferring a 2.4 GB file. On my linux desktop though, transfer speeds were much slows - like about 5 MB/s.,Gotta see how long the performance holds.,5yr warranty doesn't hurt either - though I'm more than likely to lose the key before that.,All perfect but the pen drive's capacity is only 57gb . Another 7gb not included,Its a great brand, and have quality products but there is one issue; that actual storage capacity is only 28gb white its written that its 32 gb. I know that it cant be exactly 32 gb bur 4 gb less.  I am dissapointed and I consider it as my money was wasted.,I purchased this 16GB on 21st August 2014 at the price of 370rs. It was the cheapest pendrive available at that time. I use this pendrive regularly for copying movies, installing softwares and OS etc. I partitioned the drives for installing kali linux as live. And recovered the pendrive. So after these heavy usage also this works fine. It did't show me an error message till this day.,Speed :,I tested the speed of the pendrive in my Macbook pro and attached the screenshot. It shows me 8mb/s for writing and 23mb/s for reading the data. It's not bad. You will get 4-10mb/s as write speed.,At this cost this pendrive gives lot of advantages. You can buy without having a second mind.,If you want more speed than this,then you can go for USB 3.0 drives.,Fast, reliable and 32 GB is enough storage for day to day tasks.","Reviewed in India on 26 November 2018,Reviewed in India on 17 April 2019,Reviewed in India on 19 July 2018,Reviewed in India on 27 July 2021,Reviewed in India on 7 August 2020,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2021,Reviewed in India on 21 February 2022,Reviewed in India on 26 October 2014,Reviewed in India on 10 February 2021,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,Reviewed in India on 26 August 2016,Reviewed in India on 14 August 2021"

It may harm your device. It says 16 GB but it's capacity is less than that. So you may try other product,Cheating,I have been using SanDisk products since 10 years.
